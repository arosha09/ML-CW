It has been the centerpiece of many ab-focused workouts, due to both its simplicity and the intense burn and mind-muscle connection it produces. It can be performed for time or reps as part of the ab-focused portion of any workout."
Decline band press sit-up,Strength,Bands,Intermediate,6.286607142857143,"The decline band press sit-up is a weighted core exercise that works the rectus abdominis or ""six pack"" muscles, as well as the deep core muscles.

Barbell roll-out,Strength,Barbell,Intermediate,8.9,"The barbell roll-out is an abdominal exercise that utilizes a barbell in the place of an ab roller. It is best performed with a barbell that has rotating collars, and is considered more difficult than other ab roller variations.

Two-way swing,Strength,Kettlebells,Intermediate,6.286607142857143,"The two-way kettlebell swing is an exercise that alternates a chest-height kettlebell swing (sometimes called a ""Russian"" or ""hardstyle"" swing) with an overhead kettlebell swing (sometimes called an ""American"" swing). Both swing variations work many of the same muscles, such as the hamstrings, glutes, and core, but because the weight must travel farther in the overhead swing, it's slightly more metabolically demanding and works the upper back and shoulders more. This combo can be performed for time or reps and works especially well in circuit-style or full-body training. If you can't perform the overhead swing without lower back or shoulder pain, just perform the chest-height swing."
Kettlebell crab reach,Strength,Kettlebells,Intermediate,6.286607142857143,"The kettlebell crab reach is a kettlebell pressing exercise in which the lifter presses a kettlebell overhead while in a modified single-arm bridge position.

It is performed on parallel bars, starting in the top position of a dip. Leg raises are often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or more, as part of ab-focused training.

Feet-elevated crunch,Strength,Exercise Ball,Intermediate,7.3,"The feet-elevated crunch is a variation on the basic crunch, a very popular ab move.

30 Side Plank On Ball,Strength,Exercise Ball,Intermediate,6.286607142857143,"The feet-elevated side plank on ball is a more advanced version of a traditional bodyweight side plank. The feet are balanced on an exercise ball, providing a balance challenge but also increasing the load placed upon the obliques and shoulder muscles. It is usually performed for timed holds, either one side at a time or alternating sides. If a ball is unavailable, some of the benefits of the movement can be obtained by performing side planks with the feet elevated on a couch, chair, bench, or other stable object."

Feet-elevated plank on ball,Strength,Exercise Ball,Intermediate,6.286607142857143,"The feet-elevated plank is a variation on the straight-arm plank, a bodyweight standard. The feet are elevated on a ball to align the body parallel to the floor and provide a greater stabilization challenge. This makes it more difficult than straight-arm planks on the floor, but also puts more emphasis on the shoulder muscles. It is often used as a shoulder and core warm-up, or as a burnout movement for a chest or shoulder workout."
